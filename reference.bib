In recent years, great efforts have been made to resolve complete three-dimensional (3-D) displacements from InSAR measurements. This contribution is intended to provide a systematic review of the progress achieved in this field. Based on an analysis of the InSAR LOS measurements, we first cover two commonly used techniques, i.e., Offset-Tracking and multi-aperture InSAR (MAI), with which the surface displacement in the azimuth direction can be measured together with the LOS displacement. Several methods for mapping 3-D displacements using InSAR measurements are subsequently presented and categorized into three groups: (i) combination of multi-pass LOS and azimuth measurements; (ii) integration of InSAR and GPS data; and (iii) prior information assisted approaches. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are analyzed to show the applicability of each method to specific 3-D displacement mapping cases, in hope to provide a useful guidance in choosing a suitable approach accordingly. Finally, suggestions for resolving the challenging issues and outlook of future research are given.}

Changes in the Earth’s surface can result from a wide range of phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, variations in ground water levels, and changes in wetland water levels. Time series analysis is applied to interferometric phase measurements, which wrap around when the observed motion is larger than one-half of the radar wavelength. Thus, the spatio-temporal "unwrapping" of phase observations is necessary to obtain physically meaningful results. Several different algorithms have been developed for time series analysis of InSAR data to solve for this ambiguity. These algorithms may employ different models for time series analysis, but they all generate a first-order deformation rate, which can be compared to each other. However, there is no single algorithm that can provide optimal results in all cases. Since time series analyses of InSAR data are used in a variety of applications with different characteristics, each algorithm possesses inherently unique strengths and weaknesses. In this review article, following a brief overview of InSAR technology, we discuss several algorithms developed for time series analysis of InSAR data using an example set of results for measuring subsidence rates in Mexico City.}

abstract = {Railway track health monitoring and maintenance are crucial stages in railway asset management, aiming to enhance the train operation quality and service life. For this aim, various inspection means (using diverse non-destructive testing techniques) have been applied, however, these means are mostly not able to monitor whole railway track network or track underlying layers (e.g., ballast and subgrade). The use of remote sensing techniques, such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), can expedite the defect diagnosis process for railway tracks, elevating the scope of health monitoring to a network-wide level. The Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a particularly reliable method, especially for detecting structural deficiencies in underlying layers. As a result, combining the two distinct non-destructive testing techniques – GPR and InSAR – presents a promising strategy for efficient railway asset management. Recognizing the significance of embracing newer and more advanced monitoring strategies, this paper reviews the fusion of GPR and InSAR methodologies, and explores the potential integration of machine learning models to develop a predictive health monitoring and condition-based maintenance approach for railway tracks.}

abstract = {The prediction of landslide deformation is an important part of landslide early warning systems. Displacement prediction based on geotechnical in-situ monitoring performs well, but its high costs and spatial limitations hinder frequent use within large areas. Here, we propose a novel physically-based and cost-effective landslide displacement prediction framework using the combination of Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) and machine learning techniques. We first extract displacement time series for the landslide from spaceborne Copernicus Sentinel-1A SAR imagery by MT-InSAR. Using wavelet transform, we then decompose the nonlinear displacement time series into trend terms, periodic terms, and noises. The advanced machine learning method of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) is utilized to predict the trend and periodic displacements, respectively. The modeling inputs for trend and periodic displacement predictions are determined by analyzing their corresponding influencing factors. The total displacements are finally predicted by summing the predicted displacements of trend and periodic items. The Shuping and Muyubao landslides, identified as seepage-driven and buoyancy-driven, respectively, in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China are selected as case studies to evaluate the performance of our methodology. The prediction results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can accurately establish the nonlinear relationship between the landslide deformation and its triggers. GRU outperforms the algorithms of Long Short-Term Memory networks and Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine, and the Adam algorithm can effectively optimize the model hyperparameters. The root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error are 3.817 and 0.022 in Shuping landslide, and 5.145 and 0.020 in Muyubao landslide, respectively. By integrating the advantages of MT-InSAR and machine learning techniques, our proposed prediction framework, considering the physics principles behind landslide deformation, can predict landslide displacement cost-effectively within large areas.}

Two-dimensional vertical and horizontal east-west deformation rates and time series are computed from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 imagery acquired during 2017–2022. The landslides' east-west deformation rate is significantly larger than the vertical deformation rate, so it is better suited for landslide characterization. The deformation rates remain nearly constant and unaffected by seasonal changes during the entire period, suggesting substantial landslide thickness. Two large landslides in Alberta and the largest landslide in the Northwest Territories are studied in detail to demonstrate various advanced value-added products produced from DInSAR results. From ascending and descending line-of-sight deformation rates, Surface-Parallel Flow (SPF) and Aspect-Parallel Flow (APF)-constrained three-dimensional (3D) deformation rates are computed. Landslides thicknesses are then estimated from the APF-constrained 3D deformation rates, and the limitations of these techniques are discussed. The estimated thickness of the Northwest Territories landslide reaches 100 m, suggesting that the entire permafrost block may be sliding above the non-permafrost ground. The described techniques allow for mapping slow-moving deep-seated landslides in harsh conditions in areas affected by seasonal land cover changes, as in northern Canada. The decomposition of landslide motion into two or three components in certain conditions allows us to derive landslide thickness and volume and improve the estimation of a potential hazard posed by landslides.}

The UAV equipped with an RTK (Real-time-Kinematics)-GNSS receiver and an optimized gimbal that carries an optical sensor and a laser range-finder, is able to autonomously detect, track and localize fiducial targets, using the UAV's orientation and position, exporting their coordinates in WGS 84 geodetic reference system during the flight. The system has been validated with a significant number of experiments in various environments with increasing difficulty, providing a three-dimensional error in a range of 4–15 cm.}

abstract = {Plastic hinge rotation is an efficient and essential response parameter for post-disaster damage assessment on RC structures. In this paper, a micro-electronic mechanical system (MEMS) inclinometer-based approach is developed to dynamically measure the plastic hinge rotation of RC columns under earthquake loads. The plastic hinge rotation is regarded as the relative angle of rotation, measured by inclinometers, between cross-sections such that influence from the absolute rotation of floors can be eliminated. Meanwhile, since the inclinometers are densely installed near the bottom, translational acceleration-induced error can be compensated by subtracting the lowest sensor’s output from others’. However, issues caused by rotational and translational vibration are considered as the major challenges in real applications. The contribution of external vibration to the sensor’s overall output is revealed via analysis on a simplified inclinometer model. A numerical study utilizing typical RC column’s deformation characteristics and dimensions is conducted to analyze the influence of major factors: vibrational frequency, sensor position and damage extent. A method for static and dynamic inclinometer calibration is presented. The related calibration experiments are carried out to quantify the sensor’s sensitivity as well as the relationship between rotational frequency and error. The calibration method is validated with a set of vibration tests that use three seismic waves as input. Finally, performance of the proposed approach in full scale structures is investigated through a shake table test.}

abstract = {Ultra-deep circular excavations present unique challenges in geotechnical engineering due to their complex behavior and the scarcity of relevant case studies. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the excavation behavior of the deepest circular excavation (77.3 m) ever built in China through field monitoring and computational methods. The excavation process leads to the transformation of the underground diaphragm walls into an elliptical cylinder shape, elongated in one direction and shortened in the perpendicular direction. The outer annular reinforcement primarily experiences compressive stresses, while the inner annular reinforcements undergo tensile stresses, attributed to the spatial deformation of the cylinder structure. The findings emphasize the significance of considering 3D deformation and accurate characterization of internal forces to ensure the structural integrity and stability of such complex geotechnical systems. Three computational methods, including the 2D load-structure method, the 3D load-structure method, and the stratum structure method, were employed to analyze the deformation and internal forces. Comparison between measured data and calculated results reveals differences and highlights the effectiveness of the 3D load-structure and stratum structure methods in capturing the observed behavior. The study contributes to the understanding of circular excavation for designs in geotechnical engineering.}

abstract = {This study develops an efficient Bayesian updating method with monitoring data for predicting the deformation of high rock slopes induced by excavation. The importance ranking based on random forest is introduced to identify the key rock parameters as random variables in the Bayesian updating. The surrogate models using support vector machine are constructed to approximate the physical numerical models using FLAC3D for evaluating slope deformation. A practical example involving deformation prediction of the excavated left-bank rock slope for the well-known Baihetan hydropower station in southwest China is presented. The results indicate that the developed Bayesian updating method can efficiently and accurately update the posterior distributions of rock parameters and predict the deformation of high rock slopes induced by excavation. Incorporating the monitoring data of displacement into the Bayesian updating can effectively reduce the uncertainty of rock parameters and displacement prediction. As a result, the displacement predictions made by the Bayesian updating are closer to the monitoring data than the prior displacement predictions. In addition, incorporating more monitoring data of displacement from the previous excavation stages produces more accurate displacement predictions for subsequent excavation stages.}

abstract = {Campi Flegrei caldera is an Italian high-risk volcano experiencing a progressively more intense long-term uplift, accompanied by increasing seismicity and geochemical emissions over the last two decades. Ground deformation shows an axisymmetric bell-shaped pattern, with a maximum uplift of about 120 cm, from 2005, in the caldera central area. We analyzed Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed Multi-Temporal DInSAR measurements and GNSS data to reveal and investigate a geodetic anomaly that has clearly manifested since 2021, locally deviating from the typical bell-shaped deformation pattern. This anomaly is located east of Pozzuoli town, in the Mt. Olibano–Accademia area, covers an area of about 1.3 km2 and shows, in comparison to surrounding areas, a maximum uplift deficit of about 9 cm between 2021 and 2023. To investigate the anomaly causes, we analyzed the caldera seismicity and inverted the DInSAR data to determine the primary source of the ground deformation pattern, which is consistent with a penny-shaped source located approximately 3800 m beneath the Pozzuoli town, with a radius of about 1200 m. We also found that the time evolution of the uplift deficit in the geodetic anomaly area correlates well with the earthquake occurrence, with the greater magnitude events clustering in this area. These considerations suggest the geodetic anomaly is a local response to the tensile stress regime produced by the inflating primary deformation source. This phenomenon can be influenced by the Mt. Olibano–Accademia lava domes lithological heterogeneities that may induce a localized reaction to ground deformation during the inflationary phase. Our interpretation aligns with the concentration of earthquakes and hydrothermal fluid emissions in this area, indicating the presence of faults, fractures, and fluid circulation. Accordingly, the geodetic anomaly area represents a zone of crustal weakness that requires careful monitoring and study.}

abstract = {We present a new technique to analyze L-band signals of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that have rebounded off the sea surface, with the aim of retrieving information about surface roughness in the form of the effective Probability Density Function (PDF) of the slopes. Unlike earlier techniques, which parameterize the PDF (usually as normal bivariate distributions), this approach does not constrain the surface slopes' PDF to the shape of a particular analytical distribution. This may help to understand the real information content of L-band scattered signals, which is currently unclear. After validating the algorithm by means of end-to-end simulations, we have applied it to real data. The tests on real data show that the retrievals are robust, consistent with the results obtained with standard GNSS-reflection techniques, and in agreement with independent sources of information. Moreover, the retrieved slopes' PDF present non-Gaussian features, such as skewness. A more in-depth analysis to check whether the skewness is a geophysical signature or an artifact of the technique, shows that it maps with the up-/down-asymmetries introduced by surface forces. In particular, this is the first time that GNSS-reflections have sensed and identified the up- and down-wind signature on the surface, putting and end to the 180° ambiguity that was usually attributed to GNSS observations of directional roughness.}

abstract = {The development and utilization of urban underground space is producing many deep foundation pits. On-site monitoring is a key issue to ensure the safety of the foundation excavation, especially the monitoring of the lateral displacement of the structure. The ultra-deep circular foundation excavation project (58.65 m deep, the deepest foundation pit in Shanghai) in the test section of the Suzhou River deep tunnel is one of the most challenging engineering around the world. The distributed optical fiber monitoring technology of Brillouin optical frequency domain analysis (BOFDA) was employed to monitor the lateral displacement of the deep foundation. The monitoring process lasted for 14 months, and a total of 19 times of monitoring was carried out following the progress of the excavation of the foundation pit. This paper introduces the process, methods and precautions of optical fiber monitoring from early installation, equipment debugging to data acquisition, data processing and data analysis. By comparing the fiber monitoring data with the manual monitoring data, the deformation of the deep foundation excavation is analysed. The analysis results not only obtain the deformation law of ultra-deep foundation excavation, but also prove the advantages of optical fiber monitoring in deep foundation excavation. Finally, with the support of the Smart Infrastructure Service System (iS3), the research combines optical fiber monitoring with an information platform. Under the framework of the iS3 platform, an integrated data processing and analysis module for fiber monitoring is developed, and the feasibility of remote real-time collection and analysis of monitoring data is discussed. With the support of the information platform, the monitoring data can be transmitted back to the computer terminal to realize remote monitoring.}

abstract = {The Crossrail project currently under construction in Central London has been described as "The Big Dig on Steroids", obviously referencing the Central Artery/Tunnel project in Boston completed in 2007. To address the multiple demands for timely construction performance monitoring, Crossrail envisioned the underground construction information management system (UCIMS) to monitor construction progress and structural health along the entire route, with a network of geotechnical instruments (i.e. slope inclinometers, extensometers, piezometers, etc.) and tunnel boring machine (TBM) position information. The UCIMS is a geospatially referenced relational database that was developed using an open source geographic information system (GIS) that allowed all stakeholders near immediate feedback of construction performance. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief history of geotechnical and structural monitoring software, to describe the structure and operation of the UCIMS, and to demonstrate how the functionality afforded by this system provided the requisite feedback to the stakeholders. Examples will be given regarding how the data management and visualization concepts incorporated into the UCIMS advanced the geotechnical construction industry.}

abstract = {This study focuses on development of a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based decision support system (DSS) to assist construction engineers in monitoring and controlling the excavation conditions. In this system, layout of the construction site and various instruments are represented in several data layers. Each instrument layer is integrated with a relational database, which receives data collected from the site. Applying fuzzy set theory, the system analyzes the collected data and identifies possible causes of adverse conditions. Through database queries and spatial displays, the position of the extreme instrument readings exceeding threshold limits is identified. The primary features of the system are as follows: (1) development of a knowledge base for planning layout of instruments according to design requirements, site characteristics, or instrument capabilities, (2) provision of a quality control checking list for instrument installations, (3) collection and transmission of measured data to the job site office using automated transmission technology, and (4) analysis of the collected data and diagnosis of possible causes of the adverse conditions. This system improves the instrumentation program by providing a logical and systematic manner to analyze the measured data in a real time basis. Thus, predictions of any adverse conditions and appropriate actions can be taken to prevent construction accidents. Furthermore, as compared to manual methods, the system significantly improves the computational effort and increases data accuracy and consistency.}

Thus algorithm is implemented in two steps: in the prediction step an estimation of current state of variables in uncertainty conditions is presented. In the next step, after obtaining the measurement, previous estimation is updated by weighted arithmetic mean. Accordingly, using KF in non-linear systems can be difficult. For nonlinear systems Extended KF (EKF) and Unscented KF (UKF) represent the first-order and higher order linear approximations. KF cannot predict appropriate values for modeling system behavior in more complicated systems. In the current study, in addition to referring to basic methods, a review on recent researches on Multiple Model (MM) filters has been done. More reliable estimations obtain by using two or more filters with different models in parallel, by allocating an estimation to each filter, outputs of each filter are calculated. MM Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) and Interacting MM (IMM) are the most used methods for estimating MMs.},

abstract = {Many damage detection and system identification approaches benefit from the availability of both acceleration and displacement measurements. This is particularly true in the case of suspected non-linear behavior and permanent deformations. In civil and mechanical structural modeling accelerometers are most often used, however displacement sensors, such as non-contact optical techniques as well as GPS-based methods for civil structures are becoming more common. It is suggested, where possible, to exploit the inherent redundancy in the sensor information and combine the collocated acceleration and displacement measurements in a manner which yields highly accurate motion data. This circumvents problematic integration of accelerometer data that causes low-frequency noise amplification, and potentially more problematic differentiation of displacement measurements which amplify high-frequency noise. Another common feature of displacement-based sensing is that the high-frequency resolution is limited, and often relatively low sampling rates are used. In contrast, accelerometers are often more accurate for higher frequencies and higher sampling rates are often available. The fusion of these two data types must, therefore, combine data sampled at different frequencies. A multi-rate Kalman filtering approach is proposed to solve this problem. In addition, a smoothing step is introduced to obtain improved accuracy in the displacement estimate when it is sampled at lower rates than the corresponding acceleration measurement. Through trials with simulated data the procedure's effectiveness is shown to be quite robust at a variety of noise levels and relative sample rates for this practical problem.}

This data explosion presents both opportunities and challenges for construction management in terms of effectively managing information and extracting valuable knowledge to support decision-making. In response to this challenge, the Bayesian approach has emerged as a powerful framework for addressing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in construction projects. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the development and applications of Bayesian approaches in construction management. Based on a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) systematic review methodology and supported by objective analytics techniques and digital tools, the study delineates the conceptual and methodological evolution from 1988 to 2023 of four primary Bayesian approaches: estimation-inference, modeling, simulation, and classification. The review synthesizes the advantages, limitations, and challenges associated with these approaches, highlighting their potential to incorporate prior knowledge, update beliefs based on new evidence, and model complex relationships among variables. The findings reveal a mature and diverse research landscape, with Bayesian methods being leveraged to improve decision-making across various stages and aspects of construction projects. As the construction industry continues to embrace digital transformation and data-driven approaches, the integration of Bayesian methods with emerging technologies and practices is likely to open up new opportunities for enhanced decision support and project success. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage the power of Bayesian approaches in construction management. }

abstract = {Geotechnical characterization of a project site for engineering applications is indispensable in engineering geology and geotechnical engineering, and there are many unavoidable variabilities and uncertainties during characterization of a project site. Different variabilities and uncertainties usually are lumped together and observed as the total variability, which includes both the actual variability of soil and rock properties and other knowledge uncertainties, such as measurement errors and statistical uncertainty. It is the actual variability, not the total variability, which affects directly the observed performance (i.e., actual response) of geotechnical and geological systems and is of primary interest in site characterization. This paper aims to consolidate recent advancement in Bayesian studies in site characterization and develops a Bayesian inverse analysis framework for direct quantification of the actual variability of various soil and rock properties. To facilitate development of the framework, the procedure of geotechnical site characterization is revisited from a Bayesian perspective, and the occurrence and propagation of inherent variability, statistical uncertainty, measurement errors, and transformation uncertainty during characterization of a project site are mapped explicitly to different stages in site investigation. Based on the mapping, a robust framework is developed that streamlines the formulation of likelihood functions for various soil and rock properties when estimated using different field or laboratory tests, leading to a streamlined process for applications of the proposed Bayesian framework to different site characterization problems. Application examples are provided to illustrate the implementation and step-by-step procedures of the proposed Bayesian framework.}

This research categorizes reliability assessment subjects into bridge structures, underground structures, building structures, and offshore structures. Detailed reviews of the research progress and outcomes for each category are provided. Furthermore, the current problems of Bayesian networks in engineering reliability assessment, e.g., algorithm efficiency and applicability, are discussed and several research directions worthy of researchers’ attention are provided, e.g., broadening the applicability of BNs, improving Bayesian networks algorithm, and establishment of objective reliability assessment method. Research indicates that Bayesian networks are suited for reliability assessment across various structural types, compared to traditional reliability assessment methods. Bayesian networks combine probabilistic models with detection and monitoring data, enabling dynamic updates of the structure's status and risk assessment, and providing timely reflection of the actual health condition of the engineering structure, thus offering more effective analysis for structural reliability evaluation.

This study aims to address the ambiguity problem of qualitative index quantification and the failure of high-conflict evidence fusion in risk assessment. Thus, a fast-converging and high-reliability multi-source data fusion method based on the cloud model ({CM}) and improved Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is proposed. The method can achieve an accurate assessment of subway pit collapse risks. First, the {CM} is introduced to quantify the qualitative metrics. Then, a new correction parameter is defined for improving the conflicts among evidence bodies based on conflict degree, discrepancy degree and uncertainty, while a fine-tuning term is added to reduce the subjective effect of global focal element assignment. Finally, the risk assessment result is obtained according to the maximum affiliation principle. The method is successfully applied to Luochongwei Station, where the difference between the maximum value and the second largest value of the basic probability assignment is 0.624, and the global uncertainty degree is 0.087. Both values satisfy the decision evaluation condition; however, values of other methods only satisfy one or neither condition. In addition, the proposed method requires only four cycles to reach the steady state by fusing data of the same index, which has faster convergence compared with that of other methods. The proposed method has good universality and effectiveness in subway pit collapse risk assessment.},

ABSTRACT = {This study presents a novel risk-assessment methodology for deep foundation pit projects in karst regions, aimed at enhancing project safety and decision-making processes. This approach amalgamates fuzzy dynamic Bayesian networks with a refined Dempster–Shafer (DS) evidence theory to tackle the intricate uncertainties present in such contexts. A comprehensive risk index system, derived from historical accident cases, relevant standards, and the literature, encompasses environmental, design, construction, and management factors. Initial probabilities for each risk factor are determined through the integration of expert knowledge and fuzzy theory. The enhanced Dempster–Shafer theory is utilized to fuse diverse information sources, culminating in a robust and dynamic risk evaluation model. This model leverages real-time monitoring data to dynamically assess and adjust risk levels throughout the construction process. The validation of the proposed method is demonstrated through a detailed case study of the Guangzhou Tangxi Section 1 deep foundation pit project, which effectively identified critical risk factors and facilitated proactive construction strategy adjustments. To further evaluate the reliability of the methodology, comparisons were made with three alternative methods, and applications were conducted on three additional deep foundation pit projects. These comparative analyses confirm the superior reliability and applicability of the proposed methodology across varied scenarios.},

abstract = {The Belief Function theory (BFT) has been frequently used to combine or aggregate different sources of information. In the BFT, a lot of rules to combine the available pieces of evidence have been proposed. The first one of them was Dempster’s rule of combination (DRC). It presents several drawbacks principally motivated by the normalization process used via a measure of conflict-based-combination between two pieces of evidence. This measure must be differentiated from conflict as an uncertainty-based-information measure of a piece of evidence in BFT. Many combination rules have been developed to solve the drawbacks that DRC presents, but each of them also has non-desirable behaviors in certain situations. In this work, we propose a set of mathematical properties that must be satisfied by every combination rule in BFT; we analyze some of the most known combination rules proposed in the literature, taking into account properties and behaviors. On the other hand, in this research, we present a new hybrid rule that verifies the required mathematical properties and does not present undesirable behaviors that other rules suffer. Finally, we show that the results of our proposal when it is used in practical applications are coherent.}

So far, this is still an open issue. To address this issue, many methods have been proposed, but they have not been comprehensively summarized in recent years. In this paper, a detailed survey is set forth about the optimization and application of evidence fusion algorithms based on Dempster–Shafer theory. Firstly, the principle of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory is introduced comprehensively. Then, the existing researches on modifying combination rule and pre-processed pieces of evidence to solve the counter-intuitive problem are reviewed in detail. Next, the performance of these studies is demonstrated, deeply analyzed, and discussed through experiments on general examples. And finally, the application of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory in different fields is critically summarized. What is more, analysis of the current status and the development trend of the research on evidence theory are concluded, which can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the development of the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory.}

Generally, complexity and multi-sources feature of physical information existing in tunnel construction make disaster prediction very difficult, how to accurately predict the disaster becomes a hot topic in the field of tunnel engineering. Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of evidence is a widely used method for reasoning with multiple evidences, however some unbelievable results usually appear in dealing with highly conflicting evidences by its traditional combination rule. Thus an improved fusion algorithm based on weighted average of evidence conflict probability was firstly introduced into risk prediction of water inrush disaster. Through the improved algorithm, multi-sources precursor information measured from previous model test were fused to predict quantitative risk levels of water inrush for different excavation step of subsea tunnel in the model test. The predicted high risk at the 12th excavation step by improved algorithm agreed well with actual phenomenon of intensive seepage observed in the test, while the traditional method gave a lower level. Moreover, the improved algorithm predicted a more accuracy result in the phase of water inrush (at 16th excavation step shown in test). In brief, the improved algorithm can make more accuracy prediction for water inrush disasters and will provide valuable reference for similar engineering.}

abstract = {Recently, the random field finite element method (RF-FEM) has attracted significantly increasing attention in the field of geotechnical engineering, especially for the purpose of analyzing the response of geotechnical systems due to the inherent variability of physical and mechanical properties. However, the method requires repeated finite element calculations based on a mass of sampling processes, making the computing effort expensive. The surrogate model is one of the techniques commonly adopted to alleviate the computational burden. In addition, some architectures of deep learning surrogate models are so unique that it is difficult to transfer to similar cases and to be familiar and reproducible by readers. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) surrogate model based on classical architecture, VGG6, to perform random field finite element analyses (RF-FEM). We pre-process the tabular data generated by the random filed method into an image-like format as input data. The VGG6 is used as a surrogate model to replace the original RF-FEM simulations for all subsequent calculations. The applications of the proposed method to assess wall deflection of braced excavation in clays with randomly varying cohesion cu and the friction angle φ are illustrated and compared in different cases. The excellent agreement between the VGG6 outputs and the FEM predictions demonstrated the promising potential of using VGG6s as a surrogate model for reliability analysis in spatially variable soils. Moreover, the model saves a lot of computing time and computing power and fully proves the generalization performance of the model under various cases.}

abstract = {Accurate prediction of ground surface settlement (GSS) adjacent to an excavation is important to prevent potential damage to the surrounding environment. Previous studies have extensively delved into this topic but all under the limitations of either imprecise theories or insufficient data. In the present study, we proposed a physics-constrained neural network (PhyNN) for predicting excavation-induced GSS to fully integrate the theory of elasticity with observations and make full use of the strong fitting ability of neural networks (NNs). This model incorporates an analytical solution as an additional regularization term in the loss function to guide the training of NN. Moreover, we introduced three trainable parameters into the analytical solution so that it can be adaptively modified during the training process. The performance of the proposed PhyNN model is verified using data from a case study project. Results show that our PhyNN model achieves higher prediction accuracy, better generalization ability, and robustness than the purely data-driven NN model when confronted with data containing noise and outliers. Remarkably, by incorporating physical constraints, the admissible solution space of PhyNN is significantly narrowed, leading to a substantial reduction in the need for the amount of training data. The proposed PhyNN can be utilized as a general framework for integrating physical constraints into data-driven machine-learning models.}

abstract = {Deep excavation during the construction of underground systems can cause movement on the ground, especially in soft clay layers. At high levels, excessive ground movements can lead to severe damage to adjacent structures. In this study, finite element analyses (FEM) and the hardening small strain (HSS) model were performed to investigate the deflection of the diaphragm wall in the soft clay layer induced by braced excavations. Different geometric and mechanical properties of the wall were investigated to study the deflection behavior of the wall in soft clays. Accordingly, 1090 hypothetical cases were surveyed and simulated based on the HSS model and FEM to evaluate the wall deflection behavior. The results were then used to develop an intelligent model for predicting wall deflection using the functional linked neural network (FLNN) with different functional expansions and activation functions. Although the FLNN is a novel approach to predict wall deflection; however, in order to improve the accuracy of the FLNN model in predicting wall deflection, three swarm-based optimization algorithms, such as artificial bee colony (ABC), Harris’s hawk’s optimization (HHO), and hunger games search (HGS), were hybridized to the FLNN model to generate three novel intelligent models, namely ABC-FLNN, HHO-FLNN, HGS-FLNN. The results of the hybrid models were then compared with the basic FLNN and MLP models. They revealed that FLNN is a good solution for predicting wall deflection, and the application of different functional expansions and activation functions has a significant effect on the outcome predictions of the wall deflection. It is remarkably interesting that the performance of the FLNN model was better than the MLP model with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 19.971, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of 24.574, and determination coefficient (R2) of 0.878. Meanwhile, the performance of the MLP model only obtained an MAE of 20.321, RMSE of 27.091, and R2 of 0.851. Furthermore, the results also indicated that the proposed hybrid models, i.e., ABC-FLNN, HHO-FLNN, HGS-FLNN, yielded more superior performances than those of the FLNN and MLP models in terms of the prediction of deflection behavior of diaphragm walls with an MAE in the range of 11.877 to 12.239, RMSE in the range of 15.821 to 16.045, and R2 in the range of 0.949 to 0.951. They can be used as an alternative tool to simulate diaphragm wall deflections under different conditions with a high degree of accuracy.}

	abstract = {Backbreak is an adverse phenomenon in blasting operation, which can cause, among others, mine walls instability, falling down of machinery, drilling efficiency reduction and stripping ratio enhancement. Therefore, this research aimed to develop two-hybrid {RF} (Random Forest) prediction models of random forest, which are optimized by Harris hawks optimizer ({HHO}) and sine cosine algorithm ({SCA}), for estimation of the backbreak distance. The {HHO} and {SCA} algorithms were adopted to determine two hyper-parameters (mtry and ntree) in the {RF} models, in which root mean square error ({RMSE}) was utilized as a fitness function. A database with 234 samples was established, in which six variables [i.e., hole length (L), burden (B), spacing (S), stemming (T), special drilling ({SD}) and powder factor ({PF})] were used as input variables, and backbreak was defined as output variable. Additionally, three classical regression models (i.e., extreme learning machine, radial basis function network and general regression neural network) were adopted to verify the superiority of the hybrid {RF} prediction models. The predictive reliability of the proposed models was assessed by the combination of mean absolute error ({MAE}), {RMSE}, variance accounted for ({VAF}) and Pearson correlation coefficient (R2). The results revealed that the {SCA}-{RF} model outperformed all the other prediction models with {MAE} of (0.0444 and 0.0470), {RMSE} of (0.0816 and 0.0996), {VAF} of (96.82 and 95.88) and R2 of (0.9876 and 0.9829) in training and testing stages, respectively. A Gini index generated internally in the {RF} model showed that backbreak was significantly more sensitive to L and T than to {SD}.},

abstract = {Hard rock pillar is one of the important structures in engineering design and excavation in underground mines. Accurate and convenient prediction of pillar stability is of great significance for underground space safety. This paper aims to develop hybrid support vector machine (SVM) models improved by three metaheuristic algorithms known as grey wolf optimizer (GWO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and sparrow search algorithm (SSA) for predicting the hard rock pillar stability. An integrated dataset containing 306 hard rock pillars was established to generate hybrid SVM models. Five parameters including pillar height, pillar width, ratio of pillar width to height, uniaxial compressive strength and pillar stress were set as input parameters. Two global indices, three local indices and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were utilized to evaluate all hybrid models’ performance. The results confirmed that the SSA-SVM model is the best prediction model with the highest values of all global indices and local indices. Nevertheless, the performance of the SSA-SVM model for predicting the unstable pillar (AUC: 0.899) is not as good as those for stable (AUC: 0.975) and failed pillars (AUC: 0.990). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed models, 5 field cases were investigated in a metal mine and other 5 cases were collected from several published works. The validation results indicated that the SSA-SVM model obtained a considerable accuracy, which means that the combination of SVM and metaheuristic algorithms is a feasible approach to predict the pillar stability.}

There are two main stages incorporated to achieve a reliable risk perception with high accuracy. The first stage involves the application of the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) under a statistical learning process (SLP) for detecting settlement occurrences. The second stage utilizes the Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) under the coupled simulated annealing (CSA) optimizer to predict settlement evolution. It is followed by the construction of prediction intervals and a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to facilitate deeper investigation. A real deep excavation project as part of Shanghai Metro is used as a case study to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, yielding high prediction accuracy in ground settlement prediction. Moreover, the prediction results can be expressed by two types of high-quality intervals as a promising description of uncertainties attributed to the intelligent model and collected data. Overall, the proposed two-stage LSSVM-based framework offers practical value as a decision-making support tool for stakeholders to understand and control the ground settlement as a reflection of risk status, contributing to enhancements of early risk perception and management in deep excavation engineering.}

We systematically review the extant literature of deep-learning-based data analytics for construction safety management, including: (1) image/video-based; (2) text-based; (3) non-visual sensor-based; and (4) multi-modal-based. The review revealed three challenges of existing research in the construction industry: (1) lack of high-quality database; (2) inadequate ability of deep learning models; and (3) limited application scenarios. Based on our observations for the prevailing literature and practice, we identify that future research on safety management is needed and focused on the: (1) development of dynamic multi-modal knowledge graph; and (2) knowledge graph-based decision-making for safety. The application of deep learning is an emerging line of inquiry in construction, and this study not only identifies new research opportunities to support safety management, but also facilitates practicing deep learning for construction projects.}

ABSTRACT = {Ground deformation measurements in mining areas play a key role in revealing the surface subsidence law, retrieving the subsidence parameters, warning of geological disasters and restoring the surface ecology. With the development of science and technology, there have emerged a great number of monitoring techniques and buildings of diverse protection levels. The diversity of monitoring techniques and the multiplicity of monitoring objects have brought challenges for surface deformation monitoring in the coal industry. Based on the existing deformation monitoring techniques, this paper established a framework of "space-sky-ground" collaborative monitoring system in mining area. We also constructed an AHP-TOPSIS (Analytic Hierarchy Process method- Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) preference model of "space-sky-ground" collaborative monitoring of surface deformation in mining area, and carried out engineering application. Our study shows that the framework of the "space-sky-ground" collaborative monitoring system for surface subsidence in mining areas established in this paper, combined with the AHP-TOPSIS monitoring preference model, which can fully combine the advantages of each monitoring technique, overcome the limitations of a single monitoring technique, comprehensively obtain the surface subsidence data and work out the surface deformation subsidence pattern. This information provides a data and technical support for surface environment management.},

Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can provide absolute position, but the sampling rate is limited; while the accelerometer has a higher sampling rate, its displacement is obtained through double integration, which is not suitable for low-frequency deformation monitoring. The data fusion of GNSS and accelerometer is conducive to taking advantage of both for SHM. There has been substantial research undertaken on the data fusion of GNSS and accelerate for structural health monitoring. Most studies in the field of fusion algorithms between GNSS and accelerometer for structural health monitoring have only focused on large displacement extraction. Few empirical studies have focused on the fusion algorithm of slight displacement extraction. The present study aimed to explore an on-demand fusion method with GNSS and accelerometer measurement. The methodological approach taken in this study is a mixed methodology based on the interactive multiple model (IMM) Kalman filter. Three groups of experiments were carried out to verify the proposed method. The findings show that the low-frequency displacement or absolute position is maintained by the Kalman filter of GNSS kinematic positioning, and the dynamic feature or high-frequency displacement is extracted by the IMM Kalman filter of the accelerometer. On the one hand, long-term displacement is ensured, on the other hand, the sensitivity of short-term displacement detection will not be reduced. It is hoped that this research will contribute to a deeper understanding of displacement extraction in SHM.}

Current safety monitoring of foundation pits is often achieved through manual onsite measurements with complex equipment and relies on complicated methods, which are labour intensive, time consuming, and tend to ignore the risk of accidental collapses caused by serious local deformation. To address this issue, this study develops a rapid safety monitoring and analysis method for foundation pit construction using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. The safe inclination angle of the foundation pit slope was proposed as the safety-monitoring index. Taking the images of the foundation pit captured by the UAV as input, point cloud reconstruction and surface fitting were carried out. The local deformation distribution was introduced to evaluate the local safety state of the foundation pit. The experimental results validate the potential advantages of the method.}

ABSTRACT = {We are witnessing a digital revolution in geoscientific field data collection and data sharing, driven by the availability of low-cost sensory platforms capable of generating accurate surface reconstructions as well as the proliferation of apps and repositories which can leverage their data products. Whilst the wider proliferation of 3D close-range remote sensing applications is welcome, improved accessibility is often at the expense of model accuracy. To test the accuracy of consumer-grade close-range 3D model acquisition platforms commonly employed for geo-documentation, we have mapped a 20-m-wide trench using aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, as well as iOS LiDAR. The latter was used to map the trench using both the 3D Scanner App and PIX4Dcatch applications. Comparative analysis suggests that only in optimal scenarios can geotagged field-based photographs alone result in models with acceptable scaling errors, though even in these cases, the orientation of the transformed model is not sufficiently accurate for most geoscientific applications requiring structural metric data. The apps tested for iOS LiDAR acquisition were able to produce accurately scaled models, though surface deformations caused by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) errors are present. Finally, of the tested apps, PIX4Dcatch is the iOS LiDAR acquisition tool able to produce correctly oriented models.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a convolution neural network ({CNN}) based prediction method for concrete diaphragm wall ({CDW}) deflections. {CNN} algorithm is modified for processing the {CDW} deformation data collected from in-situ measurement in both time and space dimensions, and capable of making dynamic prediction based on the extracted spatiotemporal features of wall deflection. The proposed method is validated through investigating a project of deep excavation in Suzhou, China. The predicted results show excellent agreement with field measurement and yield mean absolute errors of 0.86 mm and 1.55 mm for nowcasting and forecasting tasks, respectively. Three prevailing algorithms in time series prediction, namely, back propagation neural network, long short-term memory and autoregressive integrated moving average, are conducted for comparison. The results illustrate that the {CNN} outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy and execution time. Therefore, the proposed {CNN} model is the most suitable for {CDW} deflection prediction, and can provide reasonable references for construction safety management on site.},

High-dimensional data analytics methods have thus been developed to interpret such complex data. Among the different high-dimensional data analytics techniques, matrix and tensor decomposition methods have acquired a notable interest in the civil engineering community over the past decade. Due to their unique ability to deal with highly redundant and correlated data, these methods are establishing themselves as promising and efficient tools to analyze high-dimensional data in the civil engineering arena. In this paper, high-dimensional data is referred to as a data set in which the number of features is comparable or larger than the number of observations. This review paper aims to summarize the applications of matrix and tensor decomposition methods in civil engineering over the last decade. The survey begins with a general overview of matrix and tensor decomposition followed by highlighting their significance in the field. Afterward, various applications of these high-dimensional data analytics methods in civil engineering are presented, while the advantages offered by these methods are discussed. Finally, challenges and potential research avenues for employing matrix and tensor decomposition and future emerging trends for their novel use are highlighted.}

Moreover, their combination can establish a comprehensive view of a built environment based on data integrated, which underpins the development and transition of the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industries in the digital era. This paper gives a comprehensive review on BIM-GIS integration in sustainable built environments in order to analyse the status quo and practical applications from four viewpoints: technologies for data integration, applications in the life cycle of AEC projects, building energy management, and urban governance. Three typical modes of BIM-GIS integration, namely, "BIM leads and GIS supports", "GIS leads and BIM supports", and "BIM and GIS are equally involved", are categorised based on the different dominant positions of the two technologies. Furthermore, the research trends and future directions for the applications of BIM-GIS integration are discussed. Specifically, we underline that semantic models and third-party integration platforms should be optimised technically, and information about the whole process of AEC projects needs to be improved. Comprehensive information for building energy management should be digitised and quantified to improve its systematic integration and application to the urban built environment. This review can serve as a roadmap for researchers who focus on studies of BIM-GIS integration in the sustainable built environment.}

abstract = {This study presents a Differential SAR Interferometry (DinSAR) analysis and review of ERS (1992–2001) and Radarsat (2003–2007) data on the city of Napoli (Italy). These data are processed using the Persistent Scatterers Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR) technique and post-processed by statistical selection and filtering with the aim to obtain, by combining ascending and descending geometries, the spatial distribution of the vertical and horizontal (east–west) components of the ground displacement velocity. We identify five main areas of subsidence affecting residential districts and strategic infrastructures (transportations and industrial plants). These are: a) Vomero–Arenella district; b) Scudillo–Stella district, c) Municipio Square; d) Garibaldi Square; and e) Poggioreale district. In these areas, the ground deformation rate is between −1.3 and −10.5mm/yr and varies through time. In particular, in the investigated time period, the subsidence rate (i) persistently increases in the Scudillo–Stella and Poggioreale districts, (ii) abruptly increases in correspondence of underground construction activities (Municipio and Garibaldi squares), and (iii) decreases following the ground deformation style of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Vomero–Arenella district). More restricted areas of subsidence also occur in the northeastern, less urbanized, sectors of the Napoli metropolitan area. The subsidence triggering factors are investigated through a review of the available geological geomorphological, hydrological, and urban network information. With respect to other urban contexts, where the cause of subsidence is of natural or anthropogenic origin, Napoli shows a multiple association of triggering factors. These factors are: sub-soil excavations for the construction of transport infrastructures, filling/emptying cycles of large underground water reservoirs, gravity instability related to local morphological factors, raise of the water table with consequent hydrocompaction due to the stop of ground water withdrawal, and re-activation of volcano-tectonic faults associated to the uplift and subsidence phases (bradyseism) of the neighboring, active Campi Flegrei caldera, whose western sector includes a part of the Napoli urban area. We conclude that in a complex urban and geological setting like that of Napoli, ground deformations induced by anthropic and natural processes may coexist and should be monitored for a correct evaluation of the associated hazard and the management of the city planning activities. Finally, the combined review of satellite and geological data available for different urban districts worldwide is essential to identify the sources of ground deformation and analyze the time evolution of the related anthropic and/or natural processes.}

In particular, a novel multilevel U-tube sampler was designed in China specifically for shallow subsurface, and it had been proven both technically reliable and economically feasible in several carbon capture, utilization, and storage ({CCS}/{CCUS}) projects, including the Shengli {CO}2-enhanced oil recovery ({CO}2-{EOR}) project, the Shenhua {CCS} demonstration project, and the Jilin {CO}2-{EOR} project.

A novel method integrating {SBAS}-{InSAR} and {UAV} photogrammetry is used to analyze ground subsidence deformation in the Gesar gold mine located in Maqu, Northwest China. This approach uses {SBAS}-{InSAR} to calculate two-dimensional deformation data for capturing ascending and descending measurements. This method can provide precise information on small-sized deformations within mining regions. The deformation data obtained from {UAVs} and the vertical deformation data derived from {InSAR} are integrated to generate comprehensive and accurate ground subsidence data from the mining district. Results demonstrate that using a combined {InSAR} (vertical) and {UAV} technique to analyze surface subsidence in mining districts resolves inconsistency between the line-of-sight and deformation orientations. Furthermore, the incoherence issue of {InSAR} in regions with large deformation gradients is addressed, while the inherent errors of {UAV} monitoring of mining surface subsidence are mitigated. The genetic algorithm ({GA})-backpropagation ({BP}) neural network algorithm is combined with {InSAR} data to predict subsidence in collapsed areas. As observed, the {GA}-{BP} algorithm has the smallest residual under the same training samples. Therefore, the {GA}-{BP} neural network model can effectively predict surface subsidence in mining areas and can be used for subsequent subsidence prediction.},

The complementarity between D-InSAR and levelling is illustrated through a case study of the construction of a road tunnel beneath Glòries Square, Barcelona; D-InSAR is employed to continuously monitor the works, notably the dewatering of the site. This study focuses primarily on D-InSAR data obtained from the processing of Sentinel-1A data following a persistent scatterer interferometry procedure. The spatial distribution of the deformation and its temporal evolution are analysed with detailed hydrogeological and piezometric data. The magnitude of deformation is discussed using levelling data and an analytical estimation based on the hydromechanical parameters of the ground obtained from a pre-existing hydrogeological numerical model and pumping tests. The D-InSAR results are shown to be essential for identifying the origin of ground deformation and the constraints on its spread. Such observations at the construction site and district (~2 km radius) scales with sub-centimetric deformation are precious contributions of D-InSAR data, whereas levelling offers a more accurate quantification of the deformation, although this remains an open issue to be further investigated.}

The most accurate and widespread monitoring method to measure displacements is leveling, a point-like surveying technique that typically allows for tens of discrete in situ sub-millimeter measures per squared kilometer. Another emerging technique for mapping soil deformation is the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method, which is based on SAR images acquired from orbiting satellites. This remote sensing technique can provide better spatial point density than leveling, more extensive spatial coverage and lower-cost acquisitions. This paper analyses, compares and discusses leveling and advanced multi-temporal InSAR measurements when they are used to measure the soil deformation induced by the dewatering associated with underground constructions in urban areas. This comparison, which has not been considered in previous works, is of paramount importance to ascertain the most suitable technique (or combination of techniques) in these contexts. To do so, an experiment was performed in the future railway station of La Sagrera, Barcelona (Spain), in which leveling and advanced multi-temporal InSAR were used to quantify ground deformation by dewatering. The results showed that soil displacements measured by leveling and InSAR were not always consistent. In the context of soil deformation measurements produced by dewatering in urban areas, InSAR measurements appear to be more accurate for investigating soil deformation, whereas leveling was more appropriate for quantifying the real impact on the nearby buildings.}

By leveraging these databases, the {CM} generates the membership degrees for various evaluation indicators across different risk levels, which are then transformed into basic probability assignments within the D–S evidence theory.

ABSTRACT = {The construction of tunnels in urban areas can affect the nearby existing infrastructures and buildings, as shallow excavations induce movements up to the ground surface. An important parameter to be monitored during the excavation is the volume loss, which plays a crucial role in determining the ground movements at the surface. InSAR satellite monitoring has the potential to detect ground movements at the millimetric scale on a vast area for tunneling applications. In the present study, the Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) technique, based on the persistent scattering method, is used to retrieve vertical displacements induced by the excavation of twin tunnels of a metro line in the City of Naples (Italy). Here, the volume loss is obtained by fitting a Gaussian curve on the monitored settlement data induced by the excavation of the first tunnel. The latter is then used to predict the settlement of the second excavation about one year later and compared to the MT-InSAR data. These monitored data show the typical shape of the settlement profile, confirming the empirical Gaussian distribution and MT-InSAR capability to detect millimetric displacements. Therefore, MT-InSAR can be used to feed algorithms to improve the prediction of tunneling-induced displacements.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an optimal sensor placement (OSP) framework for parameter estimation, virtual sensing, and condition monitoring using information theory. The framework uses a Bayesian OSP method combined with modal expansion to minimize the information entropy about quantities of interest (QoI), such as strain time histories at critical locations of the structure, without the knowledge of input excitation. The proposed optimization framework also accounts for variations in sensor installation cost at different locations on the monitored structure. The framework is evaluated numerically using a realistic model of an offshore wind turbine on a jacket support structure under installation cost assumptions and considering information entropy of the QoI. The QoI in this numerical study are considered to be the strain time history at one or more locations on the support structure in one problem and the parameters of the structure in the other. A correlation length is considered to account for the spatial correlation of data between adjacent sensors. Effects of the correlation length and input loads on the OSP results for parameter estimation are studied. The considered structural parameters for estimation in this study include (1) modulus of elasticity of tower elements (tower stiffness), (2) modulus of elasticity of jacket elements (jacket stiffness), and (3) vertical foundation spring (soil stiffness). The effect of a subjective weight between the information entropy and sensor configuration cost on the OSP results is also investigated. Different optimal designs are achieved for different weight factors, and the Pareto solutions for OSP are presented. It is found that the OSP framework is an effective tool for decision-makers considering the cost of instrumentation. The presented Pareto optimal solutions can give insight into the value of OSP given a limited budget.}

UAV photogrammetry has made it possible to obtain this type of information in an economic and practical way. However, it is necessary to know the accuracy of the data and that it is within the admissible limits. There are many factors that affect the accuracy of products resulting from UAV photogrammetry. Of all of these, the effect of the number of ground control points (GCPs) and their distribution in the study area are especially significant. Different distributions of GCPs have been studied to try to optimize the products obtained by UAV photogrammetry. Of all the distributions tested, the best results were obtained with edge distribution and stratified distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to place GCPs around the edge of the study area to minimize planimetry errors. In addition, it is advisable to create a stratified distribution inside the study area with a density of around 0.5–1 GCP × ha−1 to minimize altimetry errors. The combination of these two distributions minimizes the total error obtained.}

ABSTRACT = {Ground-based/terrestrial radar interferometry (GBRI) is a scientific topic of increasing interest in recent years. This article is a bibliographic review, as much complete as possible, of the scientific papers/articles published in the last 20 years, since the pioneering works in the nineties. Some statistics are reported here about the number of publications in the years, popularity of applications, operative modalities, operative bands. The aim of this review is also to identify directions and perspectives. In the opinion of authors, this type of radar systems will move forward faster modulations, wider view angle, MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) systems and radar with capability to detect the vector of displacement and not only a single component.},

abstract = {A probabilistic model is proposed that uses observation data to estimate failure probabilities during excavations. The model integrates a Bayesian network and distanced-based Bayesian model updating. In the network, the movement of a retaining wall is selected as the indicator of failure, and the observed ground surface settlement is used to update the soil parameters. The responses of wall deflection and ground surface settlement are accurately predicted using finite element analysis. An artificial neural network is employed to construct the response surface relationship using the aforementioned input factors. The proposed model effectively estimates the uncertainty of influential factors. A case study of a braced excavation is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The update results facilitate accurate estimates according to the target value, from which the corresponding probabilities of failure are obtained. The proposed model enables failure probabilities to be determined with real-time result updating.}

abstract = {This study investigated the time-dependent behavior of a diaphragm wall and ground surface for a typical excavation in soft clay using two-dimensional finite element analysis. During excavation, deformations normally increase with time, both in the soil excavation time and the elapsed time between excavation stages. The increase may be due to consolidation and/or creep but the mechanism has never been studied comprehensively before. The hardening soil, hardening soil small strain, soft soil, and soft soil creep model were used depending on analysis requirements. Compared to the measurement, the soft soil creep model could simulate the time-dependent wall deflection and maximum ground settlement properly. Creep had a significant contribution to increasing the wall deflection while consolidation had little effect. Creep also caused a significant increase in the ground settlement both in excavation stages and elapsed times while consolidation caused the ground settlement to rebound slightly during elapsed times. The maximum wall deflection and ground settlement induced by the bottom-up method were 0.79 and 0.80 times as large as those by the top-down method, respectively. This was a contribution of a three times smaller support stiffness, elapsed time and unsupported length of the bottom-up method compared to those of the top-down method.}

abstract = {Currently, global warming is increasing rainfall intensities worldwide, particularly in China. This climate change has caused numerous underground infrastructure failures, which threatens the sustainable development of urban environments. Most failures brought about secondary hazards in densely populated areas, which often caused massive damages and casualties and/or injuries. Thus, a summary of such failures and their contributing factors on a national scale is essential for understanding the adverse influences of climate change on infrastructures, which can help urban planners, designers and engineers to improve city resilience. In this paper, an overview of 378 underground infrastructure failures in China associated with heavy rainfall was conducted. First, the latest rainfall characteristics in China were analyzed. Then, a review was conducted in four aspects, i.e., infrastructure types, involved strata, and temporal and geographic distributions. Finally, contributing factors of the failures were discussed. Several major findings were obtained: (1) the failure numbers had increased significantly since 2010, mainly attributed to the intensification of rainfall in rapidly urbanizing regions; (2) the resilience of underground infrastructures against heavy rainfall is governed by the performance of existing drainage facilities nearby; and (3) more failures clustered in the urban environments featuring highly concentrated rainfalls and thick-layered unsaturated coarse-grained soils.}

abstract = {The health state estimation and remaining useful life prediction have always been challenging when a mechanical system works under time-varying operating conditions (TVOC). TVOC can not only influence the amplitude of degradation growth, but also have an impact on how the baseline degradation process is observed. In this paper, we propose a state-space model to estimate the health state of a single-unit system under continuous TVOC. Compared to most existing works where only one discrete operating condition is considered, our model accounts for multi-dimensional and continuous TVOC. The baseline (hidden) degradation is described by stochastic processes or general path models, and the observations are subject to TVOC-related observation bias and noise. Given the raw observations and the TVOC sequences, a particle filter (PF) is used to estimate the hidden degradation process. When the model parameters are unknown, Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization is used for parameter estimation. As a result, the health state at any time and any TVOC can be estimated. The proposed method is applied to a real choke valve erosion dataset, showing a significant improvement in the health state estimation compared to traditional methods.}
